# Incredible Modpack
## How about that!
Inspired by Flowstate's ["Better Adventures+"](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-adventures-plus) modpack, Incredible Modpack attempts to expand on and improve what Vanilla Minecraft is all about.  A lot of the complexities already found within the game are hidden behind a lack of environmental diversity, obsolete mechanics, and an abundance of missed opportunities.  This modpack is explicitly designed to remedy all that and more!

Inside you'll find a collection of carefully selected and meticulously tweaked mods made by very talented individuals.  You'll also find resource packs expanded to cover any untouched sections of the modpack, allowing you to play with 32x textures without the annoying clash of unfinished 16x textures so often found in other modpacks.

## Known Problems: (Please leave a comment if you find any unmentioned issues!)

- JEI Config does not open properly
- Horses called from unloaded chunks crash the server
- Horses are transparent sometimes(?!)
- Missing 32x Textures for just a few mods (Most notably Inmis Addon)
- Sabrina skin does not affect all horse types

## Planned Features:

- Completed 32x Textures
- Custom animations
- Custom music
